1. Fix Widgets

widgets need to display this

small widget -> x/x protocols taken for the day

medium widget -> 1 , 2 , 3 protocls with checks

large widget -> displays each peptide name max of 5 protocols to display

after every protocl is completed for the day the widget should update to have a completed message and everything checked off

the widgets need to refresh in case the user creates a new protocol and wants to updaet their widget that is already created


2. Add all peptides in library from the prd

3. Remove the calendar image for blank calendar

4. fix all gemini images

5. remove duplicated save button on new protocol page

6. app app icon
